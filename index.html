      <p> I am a 3rd year Computing and Financial Management (Co-op) Student at The University of Waterloo. Through this program I have not only had academic exposure to both the fields of Computer Science and Finance but also industry experience that makes me an all rounded professional. As an undergraduate student, I utilized my co-op terms to work in all the major stages of the SDLC i.e. from collecting requirements for projects  up until quality assuring the end products. 
        <p> I belive that in order to deliver a high quality product it is important to have a deep understanding of both the business side including customer needs, business profitability, investment turnover etc. and technical side that is producing viable and smart products. My experinces in diverse roles have enabled me to thrive in technical roles where I am able to use my business acumen to deliver products with high product standards. </p>
